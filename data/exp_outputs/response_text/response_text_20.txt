**1. Summary:**
Eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix are all positive. This is because a positive definite matrix represents a quadratic form that is always positive, and its eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which reflects this positivity.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

Positive definite matrices have a special property when it comes to their eigenvalues. Let's understand this relationship step by step.

First, let's recall what a positive definite matrix is. A real symmetric matrix A is positive definite if for every non-zero vector v in the domain of A, the following inequality holds:

v^T * A * v > 0

This means that for any direction v, the quadratic form Av^2 is always positive. Now, let's consider the eigenvalues of A. The eigenvalues λ of A are the roots of the characteristic polynomial:

p(λ) = det(A - λI)

where I is the identity matrix. Since A is symmetric, its eigenvalues are real, and we can write the characteristic polynomial as:

p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)...(λ - λₙ)

Now, let's consider the expansion of this polynomial. The constant term in the expansion is the product of the eigenvalues, which is also the determinant of A:

det(A) = λ₁ * λ₂ * ... * λₙ

Since A is positive definite, its determinant is positive (det(A) > 0). Moreover, because the quadratic form Av^2 is always positive, the eigenvalues λ must also be positive (λ > 0). This is because if any eigenvalue were non-positive, the corresponding eigenvector would make the quadratic form non-positive, contradicting the positive definiteness of A.

Now, let's illustrate this relationship with a Python-based example. We'll use the NumPy library to create a positive definite matrix and calculate its eigenvalues.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a positive definite matrix
A = np.array([[4, 12, -16], [12, 37, -43], [-16, -43, 98]])

# Calculate the eigenvalues
eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)

print("Eigenvalues of the positive definite matrix A:")
print(eigenvalues)
```

When you run this code, you'll find that all the eigenvalues are positive, confirming our explanation. This example demonstrates how the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix are indeed all positive.
