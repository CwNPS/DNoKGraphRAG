Student Request: Help me understand how eigenvalues relate to positive definite matrices. Provide an explanation and Python-based example to illustrate the relationship.
Generated Response: ```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a 2x2 positive definite matrix
A = np.array([[3, 2], [2, 2]])

# Calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix
eigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A)

# Check if the eigenvalues are positive
is_positive_definite = np.all(eigenvalues > 0)

# Print the result
print(f"The matrix is {'not ' if not is_positive_definite else ''}positive definite.")

# Visualize the matrix
plt.matshow(A, cmap='hot')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('Matrix A')
plt.show()
```
