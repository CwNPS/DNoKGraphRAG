**1. Summary:**
Eigenvalues relate to positive definite matrices through their real parts. A matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive, which can be verified using Python.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

Positive definite matrices play a crucial role in various applications, such as optimization problems and least squares solutions. To understand their relationship with eigenvalues, let's consider a simple example:

Let's define a 2x2 matrix `A` with elements `[1, b; b, 9]`. This matrix is positive definite if and only if `b` is in the range `(-3, 3)`. We can verify this by calculating its eigenvalues.

In Python, we can use the NumPy library to compute the eigenvalues of a matrix. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix A
A = np.array([[1, b], [b, 9]])

# Calculate the eigenvalues
eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)

# Check if all eigenvalues are positive
if all(e > 0 for e in eigenvalues):
    print(f"Matrix A with b = {b} is positive definite.")
else:
    print(f"Matrix A with b = {b} is not positive definite.")
```

By running this code for different values of `b` within the range `(-3, 3)`, you'll find that the matrix is positive definite. Outside this range, at least one eigenvalue will be non-positive, making the matrix not positive definite.

The reason behind this relationship lies in the definition of positive definite matrices. A matrix `A` is positive definite if and only if, for any non-zero vector `v`, the inequality `v^T * A * v > 0` holds. This property is equivalent to all eigenvalues of `A` being positive.

To further explore this relationship, you can refer to the following resources from the retrieved context:

- "Linear Algebra with Applications" by Steven Leon (page 378) discusses the variety of applications of positive definite matrices.
- "Linear Algebra and its Applications" by Gilbert Strang (pages 359 and 365) provides the definition and properties of positive definite matrices, as well as their relationship with matrices having positive eigenvalues.
- "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra" by V. M. Levitan, M. A. Lubinsky, and H. N. Mhaskar (page 328) shows how minimizing a linear function subject to constraints produces a positive definite matrix.
