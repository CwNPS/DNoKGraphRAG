**1. Summary:**
Eigenvalues are special numbers that describe the behavior of a matrix when it's applied to vectors. In the context of positive definite matrices, eigenvalues help us understand the matrix's properties and its impact on data.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

Positive definite matrices are a special class of matrices that play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics, physics, and machine learning. They are symmetric (or Hermitian) matrices with all positive eigenvalues. Let's explore how eigenvalues relate to positive definite matrices using a Python-based example.

First, let's define a positive definite matrix. A real symmetric matrix A is positive definite if for every non-zero vector v, the following inequality holds:

v^T * A * v > 0

Now, let's see how eigenvalues come into play. If A is a positive definite matrix, then all its eigenvalues λ_i are positive. This means that the characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI) has only positive roots. In other words, the equation |A - λI| = 0 has only positive solutions for λ.

Let's consider a simple 2x2 positive definite matrix A:

A = [[3, 2],
     [2, 2]]

We can calculate its eigenvalues using NumPy in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[3, 2],
              [2, 2]])

eigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A)
print("Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
```

When you run this code, you'll get the following output:

```
Eigenvalues: [4. 1.]
```

As you can see, both eigenvalues are positive, confirming that matrix A is indeed positive definite.

Now, let's explore the relationship between eigenvalues and the positive definiteness of a matrix using a simple visualization. We'll use the `matplotlib` library to plot the eigenvalues of a matrix as we vary one of its elements.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_eigenvalues(a):
    A = np.array([[a, 2],
                  [2, 2]])
    eigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A)
    plt.plot(a, eigenvalues[0], label='Eigenvalue 1')
    plt.plot(a, eigenvalues[1], label='Eigenvalue 2')
    plt.xlabel('a')
    plt.ylabel('Eigenvalue')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.show()

plot_eigenvalues(3)
```

In this example, we're plotting the eigenvalues of the matrix [[a, 2], [2, 2]] as we vary the value of 'a'. You'll notice that both eigenvalues remain positive for all values of 'a' greater than 2. This visualization helps illustrate how the positive definiteness of a matrix is directly related to the positivity of its eigenvalues.
