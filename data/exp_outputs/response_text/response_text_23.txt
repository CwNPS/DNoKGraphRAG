**1. Summary:**
Sparse matrix techniques offer significant computational advantages in large-scale linear algebra problems by reducing memory usage and speeding up computations. They are particularly useful when dealing with matrices that have a large number of zero elements.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

Imagine you're working with a matrix representing a large network, like a social media platform or a power grid. Most of the connections are not present, leading to a sparse matrix with many zero elements. Traditional methods for solving linear algebra problems would treat all elements as non-zero, leading to inefficient use of memory and time.

Sparse matrix techniques, on the other hand, take advantage of the zero elements. They store and manipulate only the non-zero elements, significantly reducing memory usage. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large matrices, as it allows you to work with systems that would otherwise be impossible to handle.

Moreover, many algorithms for sparse matrices are designed to exploit their structure, leading to faster computations. For instance, Gaussian elimination can be modified to avoid filling in zeros, reducing the number of operations needed.

To illustrate this, consider the following matrix A:

```
1 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 5
```

Using traditional methods, you'd store and manipulate all 25 elements. With sparse matrix techniques, you only need to store and work with the 6 non-zero elements, reducing memory usage by a factor of 4.

**3. Specific Resources:**

To explore this further, you can refer to Chapter 7 of "Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra and Its Applications" (retrieved context). This chapter discusses various types of sparse matrices and algorithms tailored to them. Additionally, you might find it helpful to look into specific algorithms like the Conjugate Gradient method, which is particularly efficient for large, sparse, symmetric systems.

For a more visual understanding, you can check out this interactive tutorial on sparse matrices: [Sparse Matrices Tutorial](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~cain/linearalgebra/sparse.html). It provides a hands-on approach to understanding and working with sparse matrices.

Lastly, to see how sparse matrix techniques are applied in real-world problems, you can look into the [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) software collection. It includes a variety of algorithms for sparse matrices and their applications, ranging from solving linear systems to eigenvalue problems.
