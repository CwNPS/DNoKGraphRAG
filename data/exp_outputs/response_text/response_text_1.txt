**1. Summary:**
Vector spaces and linear equations are closely related, as vector spaces provide a framework to understand and solve linear equations in a more general setting.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

Imagine you're in a business scenario where you're trying to allocate resources (like money, time, or people) among different projects. You have constraints (like a limited budget or time frame), and you want to find the best allocation that maximizes your profits. This is where linear equations and vector spaces come into play.

**Linear Equations:** You're probably familiar with linear equations from your Introduction to Business Mathematics course. A linear equation in two variables, for example, looks like this: `ax + by = c`. Here, `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants, and `x` and `y` are variables representing the resources allocated to each project.

**Vector Spaces:** Now, let's think about vector spaces. A vector space is a set of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (like the constants `a`, `b`, and `c` in our equation). In our business context, vectors could represent the resources allocated to each project, and the scalars could represent the constraints or the profits gained from each project.

The relationship between linear equations and vector spaces is that every linear equation can be represented as a vector equation. In our example, the equation `ax + by = c` can be written as:

`[a, b] * [x, y] = c`

Here, `[a, b]` is a vector representing the constraints, and `[x, y]` is a vector representing the resources allocated to each project. The `*` symbol represents the dot product, which is a way to multiply vectors.

**3. Specific Resources:**

To help you understand this better, I recommend checking out the following resources:

- Khan Academy's [Linear Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/linear-equations) section for a refresher on linear equations.
- For vector spaces, Khan Academy's [Vectors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors) section is a great starting point. They have interactive visualizations that can help you understand vectors better.
- For a more practical application, you can look at [Linear Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/polynomials-and-radicals/linear-programming/a/linear-programming), which is a method for optimizing a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. This is similar to our business scenario.

Remember, the key to understanding vector spaces is to think about them as generalizations of familiar concepts like points in the plane or points in space. This will help you see how they connect to linear equations and other mathematical concepts you're already familiar with.

**Constructive Note on Weaknesses:**
While you might feel that your limited mathematical background is a weakness, it's important to remember that vector spaces and linear equations are fundamental concepts that build upon each other. By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to tackle more complex mathematical ideas in the future. Don't be afraid to take your time and ask questions when you need clarification.
